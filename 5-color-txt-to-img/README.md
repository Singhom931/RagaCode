# How to Use?
Write text in File.txt  
Run filetoimg.py  

# How does it work?
Here we take File.txt as Input  
Then convert it to foo.png  
Then compress foo.png to foocompressed.png to save reduce size  
Finally the Program attempts to read data from foocompressed.png  
And writes it to FileGenerated.txt  
(Encoding to Image Works Perfectly)  
(Decoding Special Symbols and Numbers Causes Issues)
